#Additional information

#if you want a value to not be required at
#instantiation set a default alongside a type annotation,
# e.g. age: int = 33

#if, in addition to not being required, you want
# the field to be nullable, meaning possibly assume
# the value of None, then all you need to do is wrap
# the type in Optional, e.g. age: Optional[int] = 33

#â€¢ if, in addition to nullable and not being required,
# you also want the field to not be type checked,
# then you use Any instead of the
#type, alongside a specified default, e.g. age: Any = 33
